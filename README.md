#Welcome to Preman

Preman was created to get out of the bad Postman habits where backend developers get stuck in the bad habit of investing manual testing and experimentation effort inside Postman without ever building up the value of a shared Postman collection. Preman is like Postman, but meant to be part of your source code.
