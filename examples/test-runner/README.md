## Working with this example

This example shows off how to work with Stadius's test runner.
Stadius's intent is to run against a live system.


First install the dependencies:
```bash
$ npm i
```

Then, run the tests:
The tests will start the development server.
Depending on your terminal, after the test suite, you may need to send a termination signal (usually ctrl+c) to release the STDOUT/STDIN.

```bash
$ npm run test:e2e
```
